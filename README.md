# Snake Game in Java

## Introduction

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java using the Swing library. The game consists of four classes: `App`, `Game`, `Snake`, `Food`, and `Tile`. The `App` class initializes the game, the `Game` class manages the game logic and UI, the `Snake` class represents the snake, the `Food` class represents the food, and the `Tile` class is a utility class for representing positions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-java.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Compile and run the `App.java` file, which contains the `main` method.

4. The Snake Game window will appear, and you can control the snake using arrow keys.

## Class Overview

### 1. App

- **Description:** The main class with the `main` method to initialize and run the game.
- **File:** `App.java`

### 2. Game

- **Description:** Manages the game logic, UI, and main game loop.
- **File:** `Game.java`

### 3. Snake

- **Description:** Represents the snake, controls its movement, and handles collisions.
- **File:** `Snake.java`

### 4. Food

- **Description:** Represents the food that the snake can eat.
- **File:** `Food.java`

### 5. Tile

- **Description:** Utility class for representing positions on the game board.

- The snake grows longer by eating food.
